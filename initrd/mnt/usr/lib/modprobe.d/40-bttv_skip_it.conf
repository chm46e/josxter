# These devices have bt878 chip without PCI Subsystem ID. Without that info bttv
# does not know how to treat them properly. Therefore we disable autoloading of
# modules for these devices.
# See https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=149588
# To enable your device create a hardware configuration file for your device.
# See man hwup for details.
# You will probably have to specify an option to identify your card. Have a
# look in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/CARDLIST.bttv.
