#
# Every kernel module has a flag 'supported'. If this flag is not set loading
# this module will taint your kernel. You will not get much help with a kernel
# problem if your kernel is marked as tainted. In this case you firstly have
# to avoid loading of unsupported modules.
#
# Setting allow_unsupported_modules 1 enables loading of unsupported modules
# by modprobe, setting allow_unsupported_modules 0 disables it. This can
# be overriden using the --allow-unsupported-modules commandline switch.
#
# CAUTION: In SUSE Linux Enterprise products, loading unsupported modules
# is disabled by default. Re-enabling it is discouraged, as it may compromise
# enterprise product supportability.
#
# SLE users, please read the documentation about kernel module support in the
# SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Administration guide:
#
# https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/book_sle_admin/data/sec_admsupport_kernel.html
#
# NOTE: Modules from SUSE partners delivered under the SUSE SolidDriver Program
# are marked as "externally supported". Such modules are not regarded as
# "unsupported" and thus unaffected by the "allow_unsupported_modules" flag.
#
# On openSUSE, the kernel doesn't have the feature to recognize supported modules,
# and this flag has no effect.
